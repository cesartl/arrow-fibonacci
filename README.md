# Arrow Fibonacci

Fast implementation of Fibonacci sequence using Matrix multiplication and 
[Exponentiation by Squaring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring).

The implementation leverages the [Monoid](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/arrow/typeclasses/monoid/) 
typeclass from the Arrow library.
